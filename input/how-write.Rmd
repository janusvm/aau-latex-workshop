# Writing LaTeX code

For this part, I will explain the syntax of LaTeX in very general terms:

- The document class

- Installing and importing packages

- Commands

- Environments

The best way of learning the details of the LaTeX syntax (i.e. all the different commands and symbols) is by trial and error.

There will be a set of exercises at the end for this.
